# Physics Engine

A physics simulation built from scratch:
-Create objects in the main function
-Forces and any frame dependant data are to be put in the scene's run function (which is called at each frame)
-Run the simulation, in the example scene, when one clicks on the screen, a force is applied on the ball

This code is very general. For instance, it can be used equally for top view simulations (like minigolf) or side view simulations (with gravity).

For the moment, this simulation only handles moving/static collisions (not moving/moving collisions)

Basketball.pyw is an example of a game built using the prior physics engine.
